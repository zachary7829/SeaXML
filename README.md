# SeaXML
Get value of key from XML in C. (Note: My code is terrible, please don't use). This library is currently *very* primitive and lacks getting anything other than strings, and any string that doesn't have <string> and </string> in the same line. I'm mainly using this for reading unsigned shortcut files in my project Buttermilk (https://github.com/zachary7829/Buttermilk) for shortcut to butter conversion.
